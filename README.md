# Asher Ruiz - HW 5 - CSS Cards

## Margin

### Where

Just about everywhere that I felt needed it.

### Why

This helped me put needed space between elements/boxes so things would not stick together. I used % for these and padding so that responsiveness was a bit better.

## Padding

### Where

Just about everywhere that I felt needed it.

### Why

Padding helped me position my images and texts so that they fit in adjusted from the borders. It also allowed for visually-nice spacing.

## Display

### Where

Profile Cards

### Why

I needed them to line up with each other as if in a "line" rather than following the typical css format where they are aligned vertically. In the future I might consider a flex box rather than this for better responsiveness.

## Position

### Where

On my Ribbons and card elements (relative and absolute)

### Why

I needed my ribbons to align on the corner edges of the cards and absolute positioning was the only way. As part of absolute positioning, the parent element needs to be relatively positioned.

## Stand-out Card

I decided to make my card gold and silver which unfortunately did not match my image lol. However, hopefully, the employer is deceived by this.
